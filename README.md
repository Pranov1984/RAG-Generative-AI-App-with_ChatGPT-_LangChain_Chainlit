Here we will implement an advanced RAG System with ChatGPT, LangChain and Chainlit to build a File QA UI-based chatbot with the following features: 
PDF Document Upload and Indexing RAG System for query analysis and response Result streaming capabilities (Real-time output) Show document sources of the answer from RAG system


Let’s build an app to demonstrate usefulness of a RAG based Chabot

Key Tools used:
Langchain
OpenAI LLMs
ChainLit
Google Colab


Explore the app by analyzing the SEC 10-Q filings for a few companies — Oracle, Salesforce, WDAY and Microsoft — by uploading their documents and interacting with them through natural language questions. The goal is to simulate the kind of insights a financial analyst would typically seek while reviewing these lengthy (~100 -page) reports.
By leveraging AI, we aim to streamline the discovery of key financial metrics, risk disclosures, and strategic commentary hidden within the filings.
